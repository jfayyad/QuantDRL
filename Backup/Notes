1. LeNet with MNIST
2. Include all Layers (convs + fcs)
3. Modify the States fromat (Observations) and analyze them
4. Modify the Reward System and analyze it (layer-bitwidth-wise reward). Also, check KL-Div for the output layer or layer-wise
5. Backward Pass for Kernel-wise quantization
6. Try different DRL algorithms and compase
